## CO2 Sensor Choice

Which CO2 sensor to use is a difficult choice. Well known suppliers like Arduino, SparkFun, and Adafruit likely have better support and documentation, but they are also more expensive and have costlier and slower shipping. Off brand Amazon options are cheap and ship quickly but who knows how well they work or how they they are documented.
