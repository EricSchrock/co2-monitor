# First Prototype

The goal of our first prototype is to just get something working. Additionally, we need to acquire and learn any tools we don't already have (soldering iron, logic analyzer, etc.).

## Parts List

Some of these items are optional. The parts list for the second prototype will be more precise.

| Item                       | Notes                              |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Raspberry Pi               | Reuse 4B from labs                 |
| Arduino Nano 33 IoT        | Make sure it comes with headers    |
| USB cables for Pi and Nano | Power and programming              |
| USB wall wart for Nano     | Use wall power for sensor units    |
| CO2 sensors                | May want to try multiple types     |
| Breadboard                 | Any size 20 rows or larger for now |
| Breadboard wire kit        | For CO2 sensor                     |
| Resistor and capacitor kit | For pull ups and power smoothing   |
| Soldering iron             | For CO2 sensor                     |
| Soldering station          | With clips to hold components      |
| Oscope or logic analyzer   | For I2C debugging                  |
